# Data set simulation

This tool contains tools for creating large data sets of synthetic (yet realistic) transition-metal XP spectra base on reference data. Exemplary JSON files containing the parameters used during simulation available in the [`params`](https://github.com/surfaceanalytics/xpsdeeplearning/tree/main/simulation/params) subfolder. The reference data that is used as input for the simulation is available inside [`data`](https://github.com/surfaceanalytics/xpsdeeplearning/tree/main/data).
